                  Extracurricular activities refer to activities that take place outside the traditional academic
                  curriculum, typically organized by schools or community organizations. These activities can range from
                  sports and clubs to music, drama, and other arts. Participating in extracurricular activities is a
                  great way for students to develop skills, build friendships, and pursue their interests outside the
                  classroom.

              <strong>PICNIC</strong> is a great way for our department BSc CSIT to get together outside of the classroom and bond over
              food, games, and other activities. The picnic can be held at a park or other outdoor location, and can be
              planned for a weekend or holiday when everyone is available to attend. <br>
              Games and activities are an important aspect of any picnic, and can help to create a fun and engaging
              atmosphere. Activities can include sports such as frisbee, volleyball, or soccer, as well as games such as
              board games, card games, or trivia contests.
              <br>
              It's important to make sure that everyone is comfortable and safe during the picnic. Participants should
              be encouraged to bring sunscreen, hats, and other protective gear to protect themselves from the sun, and
              first aid supplies should be on hand in case of any accidents or injuries. <br>
              It's also a good idea to plan some downtime for the picnic, so that participants can relax and socialize
              with one another. This can be a great opportunity for new students to get to know their classmates and
              seniors, and to feel more connected to the department as a whole.

              <strong>GAMES</strong> can be an important part of the BSc CSIT experience, as they can help to promote teamwork,
              communication, and problem-solving skills among students. There are a variety of games that can be played
              within the department, including physical games, board games, and online games.
              <br>
              Physical games such as soccer, basketball, or volleyball can be great for promoting teamwork and physical
              fitness. These games can be played outdoors or in a gym, and can be organized by students or faculty
              members.
              <br>
              Board games such as chess, Scrabble, or Risk can be a fun way to exercise the mind and promote strategic
              thinking. These games can be played indoors, and can be a great way to pass the time during breaks or
              downtime.
              <br>
              Online games such as Fortnite, League of Legends, or Dota 2 can be a great way to connect with other
              students and to develop skills in teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These games can be played
              on individual computers or in gaming clubs, and can be a great way to build social connections within the
              department.
              <br>
              In addition to these games, there are also programming competitions, hackathons, and other events that can
              be organized within the BSc CSIT department. These events can be a great way for students to showcase
              their skills in programming and technology, and to connect with other students who share similar
              interests.
              <br>
              Overall, games can be an important part of the BSc CSIT experience, and can help to foster a sense of
              community and teamwork within the department. By organizing games and events, students can develop
              important skills and form lasting friendships with their peers.
